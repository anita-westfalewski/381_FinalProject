### Figure 1 Discussion
As shown in the image, my nightly sleep durations fluctuate extremely throughout the first 3 months of 2023 with my average being 5.95 hours a night. I would say this is an insufficient amount of sleep and is very unsustainable in the long term and puts me at risk for several diseases and health risks in the future. This is the last project of my degree so I am hoping to catch up on all the sleep debt I have accumulated (LOL!) ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… My lowest sleep duration was 2.32 hours on Janurary 6th and my greates amount of sleep was 8.63 hours on February 15th.

### Figure 2 Discussion
Figure 2 shows the frequency of my sleep states over the past 3 months. The majority of my sleeps this year have been categorized as "minimal" meaning 51/90 days I only got between 4-7 hours a night ðŸ˜¨. I experienced a less than ideal amount of "deprived" sleeps where I slept less than 4 hours for 11 nights ðŸ˜µ. I got "adequate" sleep (7-9 hours) for 28 nights and never slept more than 9 hours this quarter.
